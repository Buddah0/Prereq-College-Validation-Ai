# License Summary

**Project license:** MIT License (see `LICENSE` in repository root).

This repository is published under the **MIT License**. That means:

- **You are free** to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software.
- **No warranty** is provided; the software is provided "as is".
- **Copyright attribution** must be preserved (keep the `LICENSE` file and copyright notice).

## What this repo contains

This repository contains the **core, community edition** of the AI Course Prerequisite Validator:
- Ingestion parsers and sample catalog parsers
- Graph builder and core analysis algorithms (cycle detection, longest path, basic metrics)
- Example datasets and demo scripts
- Documentation and developer tooling

## Commercial and Enterprise Features

Some features and services are **reserved for commercial/enterprise offerings** and are not included in the community edition:
- Hosted SaaS with multi-tenant management and SLAs
- Official SIS connectors (enterprise-grade integrations)
- Advanced rules engine and enterprise policy modules
- Priority support, onboarding, and professional services

These enterprise features may be offered under a separate commercial license or as a hosted service. The presence of the MIT license on the community edition does **not** imply that enterprise features are included in the public repo.

## Contributor Policy and Future Licensing Flexibility

To preserve future flexibility for licensing and commercial options, we request contributors follow the repository contribution process described in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. In particular:
- **Sign your commits** using the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) sign-off (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
- This helps maintain clear contributor provenance and makes future licensing decisions (including dual-licensing or commercial licensing) feasible.

## Questions about licensing or commercial use

If you are an organization interested in a commercial license, hosted offering, or enterprise integration, please see `COMMERCIAL.md` (if present) or open an issue labeled `business` to start a conversation.
